This is a simulation of the "Monty Hall" problem to run on a
ZX Spectrum.

A .tap file is included which can be run on an emulator such as fuse.

If you want to build then you will need to use an assembler such as
pasmo. It is highly likely that you will need to change the supplied
"build.cmd" file since it is hard-coded to the installation folder of
my copy of pasmo.
